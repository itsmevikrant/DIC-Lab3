Are You Intimidated by Classical Music and Art?
What is your opinion on classical music, modern art, theater or opera? Why do you feel the way you do?
In “A Note to the Classically Insecure,” Miles Hoffman writes:
Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:
— Do you suffer from what Mr. Hoffman calls “Classical Music Insecurity Complex”? In other words, are you intimidated by highbrow art forms like classical music, art and theater? Why do you think this is?
— Did reading this article change your mind about classical music at all? Would you be any more willing to attend a performance or listen to a piece than you were before? Why or why not?
— Mr. Hoffman writes that “there’s no denying that the more we know about music, as with cooking or gardening or football, the more levels of enjoyment are available to us.” Do you agree with this statement? Are there times when knowing too much about something might actually hinder your appreciation and emotional experience of it? Can you give an example?
— The Times has reported that orchestras are one of America’s least racially diverse institutions and, until recently, were mostly made up of men. Do you think it’s important for more people to feel like they can participate in classical music and other art forms? If so, why and how might they be encouraged to do so? If not, why not?
