What Musical Piece Would You Nominate for a Pulitzer Prize?
Every year, the Pulitzer Prize for music is awarded “for distinguished musical composition by an American that has had its first performance or recording in the United States during the year.” Take a look at the past winners here. What do you notice about these artists and compositions? What do you wonder?
In “Kendrick Lamar Wins Pulitzer in ‘Big Moment for Hip-Hop’,” Joe Coscarelli writes:
Students: Read the entire article, then tell us:
— What is your reaction to Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer Prize for “DAMN.”? Do you think the award was well-earned? Why or why not?
— Do you agree with the jurors that rap music can be artistic, experimental and sophisticated? Why or why not? Can you give any examples to support your opinion?
— Do you think this is a “big moment for hip-hop”? Is it an important moment for the Pulitzers as well? Why do you think so?
— In your opinion, are there other genres of music that are overlooked as “serious” or “legitimate” enough to win this prestigious award? If so, what are they? Why do you think they could be worthy of a Pulitzer? Why do you think they often go unnoticed?
— If you could nominate a musical piece that meets the criteria for a Pulitzer Prize, what would it be and why?
