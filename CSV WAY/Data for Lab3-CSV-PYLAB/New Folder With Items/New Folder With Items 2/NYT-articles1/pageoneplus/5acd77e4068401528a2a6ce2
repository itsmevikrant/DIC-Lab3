Corrections: April 11, 2018
INTERNATIONAL
The Com Journal on Monday about East Timor’s efforts to promote eco-tourism referred imprecisely to the tank used by Fizzy Moslim, a diving instructor. It was a scuba tank, or diving tank — not an oxygen tank. Such tanks typically contain compressed air, not solely oxygen.
OBITUARIES
An obituary on Sunday about the sportswoman and firearms authority Sheila Link misspelled the name of the company where Mrs. Link’s father was an executive. It is Aramco, not Aramaco.
•
An obituary on Saturday about the jazz pianist Cecil Taylor misspelled the given name of one of the composers whose music Mr. Taylor enjoyed. It is Gyorgy Ligeti, not Gyorgi.
•
An obituary on Friday about the actress Susan Anspach misidentified the writer of the play “The Journey of the Fifth Horse.” It was written by Ronald Ribman, not Turgenev. (The play was an adaptation of Turgenev’s short story, “The Diary of a Superfluous Man.”) It also misstated when Ms. Anspach’s all-nude final scene in “Hair” took place. It was at the end of the first act, not at the end of the show.
•
An obituary on Saturday about Daniel Akaka, a former Democratic senator from Hawaii, misidentified the unit Mr. Akaka served in during World War II. He served in the 100th Infantry Battalion, not the 100th Infantry Division.
