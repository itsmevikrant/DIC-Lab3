What the Heck Is That?: AUBADE
SPECIAL POST — Good morning! You have to get up pretty early to fool most crossword solvers, but this week there was an entry in the Friday, March 9, puzzle by Neville Fogarty and Doug Peterson that sent a lot of people running to the dictionary.
The answer to the clue at 2-Down, “Poem greeting the dawn,” was AUBADE. An AUBADE can also be a musical composition about the morning.
An AUBADE’s counterpart, a poem or song about the evening, is called a “nocturne.”
The word was first used in 1678 and was adopted by the French from the Spanish word “alba,” meaning sunrise. Ben Zimmer, the language columnist for The Wall Street Journal, says that “A skim of Google Books shows that AUBADE appeared chiefly in French sources, or French-English dictionaries, until the early 19th century.”
An example of an AUBADE would be John Donne’s “The Sun Rising,” which, if nothing else, shows that Mr. Donne was clearly not a morning person.
Besides “Poem greeting the dawn,” some of the ways crossword solvers might see AUBADE clued are “Morning music,” “Morning song” and “Sunrise song.”
And with that, we wish you a wonderful start to your day.
