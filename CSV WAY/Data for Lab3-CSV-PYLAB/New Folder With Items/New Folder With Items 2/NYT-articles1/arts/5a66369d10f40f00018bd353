Camila Cabello’s Solo Debut Opens at No. 1
The girl group Fifth Harmony has made three albums, none of which has risen higher on the Billboard chart than No. 4. But the first solo release by a former member, Camila Cabello, went straight to No. 1 after her song “Havana,” featuring Young Thug, has been a staple at radio and streaming services since late last year.
Ms. Cabello’s “Camila” (Syco/Epic) opened with the equivalent of 119,000 sales in the United States, including 65,000 copies sold as a complete album and 57 million streams, according to Nielsen. As Billboard noted, the 20-year-old Ms. Cabello, who left Fifth Harmony at the end of 2016, is the first female artist to open at No. 1 with a debut album in three years, since Meghan Trainor in January 2015.
Also on the latest chart, the soundtrack to “The Greatest Showman,” the P.T. Barnum biopic, which had held the No. 1 spot for the last two weeks, fell to No. 2. Ed Sheeran’s “÷” is in third place, Post Malone’s “Stoney” is No. 4, and Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” is No. 5.
