‘Black Panther’ Is No. 1 on the Album Charts, Too
“Black Panther” is an official blockbuster at the box office, and its soundtrack is a hit too, opening at No. 1 on the Billboard chart.
The soundtrack, put together in part by Kendrick Lamar, features Mr. Lamar, the Weeknd, SZA, Khalid and James Blake, and opened with the equivalent of 154,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. Of that, 52,000 sales were made of the complete album, with streaming numbers dominating the rest.

The album was released by Top Dawg Entertainment, whose founder (and “Top Dawg”), Anthony Tiffith, produced and curated it with Mr. Lamar, that label’s biggest star.
Also this week, Justin Timberlake’s “Man of the Woods,” last week’s top seller, fell to No. 2. The soundtrack to “The Greatest Showman,” the P.T. Barnum biopic, is in third place; Migos’s “Culture II” is No. 4; and yet another soundtrack, to “Fifty Shades Freed” — a new entry on the chart, with songs by Sia, Julia Michaels, Rita Ora and Liam Payne — rounds out the Top 5.
