China and the U.S. have both played down the possibility that this week’s negotiations could resolve simmering trade tensions between the two countries.
But The NYT’s Keith Bradsher reports a lack of experience in international trade law among Chinese officials “could make it even harder for the two sides to find common ground before the talks end on Friday.”
The issue: China’s commerce ministry was broken in March into three separate groups each focused on different issues. People involved with the negotiations say the reorganization robbed resources and support from the ministry’s office of trade negotiations.
Mr. Bradsher reports:
Last month SunPower and SolarWorld Americas agreed to merge. The reason? The tariffs recently imposed by the Trump administration.
In barely three months, the tariffs — the first shot fired by President Trump in his escalating trade offensive — are fundamentally reshaping the solar industry and its prospects, reports The NYT’s Ivan Penn.
Growth in the solar industry is estimated to be about 11 percent lower than projections before the tariffs. Those diminished prospects are what prompted SunPower to bulk up its operations by pursuing the purchase of SolarWorld.
“The industry is in a scramble to figure out what all of the impacts are,” said Rob Freeman, chief executive of Tradewind Energy, which is based in Kansas outside Kansas City and develops industrial-scale solar and wind projects. “I think it’s fair to say it could be worse. I think it’s fair to say it’s a significant negative.”
CNBC called it “bizarre.” Investors appear to agree: Tesla’s shares are down 6.4 percent Thursday morning.
Let’s recap:
• Elon Musk dismissed a question from Sanford Bernstein’s Toni Sacconaghi about capital expenditures and said, “Boring, bonehead questions are not cool.”
• After RBC Capital Markets’s Joe Spak asked about Model 3 reservations, Mr. Musk said that he’d talk to retail investors because analysts’ questions were “so dry.”
• When asked if Tesla should keep its electric car charging network to itself as a strategic asset, Mr. Musk said, “I think moats are lame.”
Liam Denning of Bloomberg Opinion wrote, “Folks, this is not a good sign.” Rebecca Lindland of Kelley Blue Book told CNBC, “Elon, you’ve got to grow up.”
CNBC has a good roundup of reactions from Wall Street analysts. Here’s a look at a few:

Adam Jonas, an analyst at Morgan Stanley:
Ryan Brinkman, an analyst at JPMorgan:
Alexander Potter, an analyst at Piper Jaffray:
What Tesla actually reported: Another loss, and a pledge to reduce its cash burn.
Our question: If Tesla asks Wall Street for money again, what will the answer be?
The Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking a court order directing Shawn Carter, the hip-hop artist known as Jay-Z, to comply with its subpoena to testify in its investigation of Iconix Brand Group.
In 2007, Iconix bought the rights to the Rocawear brand, which Mr. Carter co-founded, for about $200 million. As part of the deal, Iconix entered into a separate joint venture with Mr. Carter.
From the S.E.C.’s statement:
The S.E.C. issued a subpoena in November seeking Mr. Carter’s testimony, and a second subpoena in February after Mr. Carter changed lawyers.
The private-equity giant shares rose 4 percent Thursday morning after it said it plans to convert to a corporation from a partnership.
Henry R. Kravis and George R. Roberts, K.K.R.’s co-chairmen and co-C.E.O.s, said:
The new structure will become effective on July 1.

The announcement came a K.K.R. reported first-quarter results.
Critics’ corner

Customers fled after the Facebook controversy, forcing the consultancy to file for bankruptcy protection. But there’s a new company, Emerdata, that could essentially be Cambridge Analytica 2.0, according to the NYT.

Elsewhere in tech: Facebook fired an employee who bragged on Tinder about access to user information. Investors weren’t impressed by Spotify’s first financial report as a public company. Mark Pincus, Zynga’s founder, cut his voting power at the game maker — making it easier to sell. A senator asked Uber to waive its arbitration clause for women who say its drivers sexually assaulted them. Meituan Dianping, a Chinese food delivery and e-commerce company backed by Tencent, is investigating reports of a data breach.
The latest threat: a ban on government agencies and their contractors buying equipment from companies like Huawei and ZTE. Both companies’ phones are now banned from sale on U.S. military bases worldwide. (Meanwhile, President Xi Jinping’s tightening grip on his country’s tech giants may hurt their global competitiveness.)
Some members of this week’s U.S. delegation to China are striking a tough tone. Peter Navarro, a hard-line trade adviser, told the NYT, “The discussions will take place in Beijing; the decisions will take place in Washington.”
One problem: That delegation is split over how to negotiate, and even what to ask for. And Beijing has continued counterpunching.
Elsewhere in trade:  The U.S. and Brazil disagree over whether they have a tariff deal.

Xiaomi, one of the world’s biggest smartphone makers, has filed to go public in Hong Kong. It’s expected to raise about $10 billion at a market valuation of $80 billion or more, according Cate Cadell and Julie Zhu of Reuters, who say it’s China’s biggest tech I.P.O. since Alibaba — a huge win for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.
Your Xiaomi cribsheet: Much of its growth has come outside China, particularly in India. But the gross profit margins on its devices are just about 8.8 percent. (The latest iPhones’ margins: an estimated 60 percent.)

Everyone was optimistic, with one executive declaring that “the rules of economic cycles may no longer apply.” But many hedge fund managers are more concerned with survival. Others worry that it will be harder to coordinate a global response to the next geopolitical crisis.
