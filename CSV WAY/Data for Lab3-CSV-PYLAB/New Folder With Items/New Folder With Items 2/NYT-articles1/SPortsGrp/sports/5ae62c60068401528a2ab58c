Zurich Extends Sponsorship of New Orleans PGA Event to 2026
AVONDALE, La. â€”  Zurich Insurance executives say they're extending the company's title sponsorship of the New Orleans-area PGA Tour event for seven years.
The extension begins after next year's Zurich Classic and runs through 2026.
Zurich began its sponsorship of the event in 2005, just months before Hurricane Katrina devastated the area and damaged the host course, the TPC Louisiana.
PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan says Zurich's commitment to remain as sponsor for 20-plus years is "extraordinary." Monahan also complimented tournament organizers for their innovation, from the two-player team format to the first-tee "walk-up" music chosen by each team.
Steve Worthy heads the Fore! Kids Foundation, which serves as the tournament's local host organization. He says the extension does not bind the tournament to a specific course. But Worthy stresses that officials have been happy at the TPC Louisiana and don't foresee a change.
