Justin Timberlake Down, Meek Mill Up: How Twitter Swings Public Opinion
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
Justin Timberlake’s Super Bowl halftime performance was widely criticized, but in many ways, that response was preordained, the endpoint of a backlash that had been swelling for months on Twitter. That is how criticism works these days — it is rapid-fire groupthink, irascible and tart, and occasionally powerful enough to shift the broad public perception around an artist.
It can work both positively and negatively. In 2015, Meek Mill’s rise was brought to a screeching halt following an unsuccessful attempt to beef with Drake. Since then, his music career has cooled and he’s been in an extended battle with the legal system. (He is currently in jail for a probation violation.) But when the Philadelphia Eagles made his song “Dreams & Nightmares (Intro)” their unofficial anthem, and won the Super Bowl, Meek Mill became an unofficial hero. Public sentiment about him had thoroughly flipped.
On this week’s Popcast, Mr. Caramanica discusses how artists get canceled — or rehabilitated, or both — on Twitter, and then in the public consciousness, with Justin Charity, a writer for the Ringer and a co-host of the Damage Control podcast.
