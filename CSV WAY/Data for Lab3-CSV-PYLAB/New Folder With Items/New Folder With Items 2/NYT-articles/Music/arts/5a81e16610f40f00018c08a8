Berklee College Expands Online, to Graduate Degrees
Berklee College of Music, already the world’s largest provider of online music degrees, will add graduate programs to its digital offerings this fall.
It will begin with a master of music in music production and a master of arts in music business. The conservatory, whose main campus is in Boston, plans to add other degree programs in the future, and is already at work on an online graduate program in film scoring, though it has not announced when that will become available.
“The goal is to expand online programs where they meet student demand,” Carin Nuernberg, the school’s vice president of online education, said in an email. “Online study takes advantage of interactive, collaborative technologies that allow for the sharing of ideas and work in a distributed, more affordable context, which in many ways mirrors what is happening in the music industry today.”
The new graduate programs, which open for applications on Feb. 21, will consist of 12 courses each and can be completed in a single year. The annual cost of tuition and fees will total $33,695, which is roughly 20 percent less than the cost of an in-person degree.
The graduate programs augment an online education program that already includes nine degree paths for undergraduates, as well as certificate programs and à la carte course offerings.
In 2002 Berklee became the world’s first music college to offer online courses, it said in a statement. The college’s online programs now enroll more than 11,000 students each year, Ms. Nuernberg said.
