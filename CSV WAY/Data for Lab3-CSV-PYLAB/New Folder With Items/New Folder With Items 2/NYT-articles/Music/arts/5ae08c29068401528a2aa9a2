Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar Break Boundaries
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
On each of the last two weekends, Beyoncé headlined the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, performing a set that was huge in ambition and historical scope and stunning in execution. Much has been made of the fact that the singer, 36, has yet to win an album of the year Grammy, but these performances established her on a higher plane of achievement.
And in between those sets, another milestone moment: The first Pulitzer Prize for music awarded outside of classical or jazz went to Kendrick Lamar, for his album “DAMN.” It was both a significant shift in perspective for the prize, and also an after-the-fact arrival for hip-hop into yet another hallowed hall. (And while we’re here, it was also an implicit rebuke to the Grammys, which have also consistently denied Mr. Lamar its top honor.)
To talk about Beyoncé’s breakthrough performance and Mr. Lamar’s Pulitzer Prize on this week’s Popcast, Mr. Caramanica is joined by Doreen St. Félix, a staff writer for The New Yorker, and Salamishah Tillet, an associate professor of English and Africana Studies at the University of Pennsylvania and a regular contributor to The New York Times. And to discuss the history of the Pulitzer Prize for music, Mr. Caramanica is joined by Zachary Woolfe, the classical music editor for The Times.
