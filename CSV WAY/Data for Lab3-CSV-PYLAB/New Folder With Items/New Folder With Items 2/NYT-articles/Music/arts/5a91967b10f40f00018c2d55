In Defense of Soundtracks. And Fergie.
The Popcast is hosted by Jon Caramanica, a pop music critic for The New York Times. It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.
This week’s Popcast has two parts. The first half covers the recent soundtrack renaissance: “Black Panther,” “The Greatest Showman” and “Fifty Shades Freed” have all released successful soundtracks, and all three are currently in the Top 5 of the Billboard album chart.
Is the soundtrack merely merch for a successful film? Is the format actually extremely well-suited to the playlist era? To address these questions, Mr. Caramanica is joined by Jon Pareles, the Times’s chief pop music critic, and Rob Harvilla, who writes about culture for The Ringer.
But wait — there’s more. Last weekend, Fergie sang the national anthem at the N.B.A. All-Star Game, and was roundly derided on social media for her effortful blues-nightclub rendition. But was it truly as awful as the reaction would indicate?
To debate this, and to talk about questionable anthem performances of years past, Mr. Caramanica was joined by Mr. Harvilla, Mr. Pareles, Caryn Ganz, the Times’s pop music editor, and Joe Coscarelli, the Times’s pop music reporter. Mr. Caramanica also has a conversation with Nick Perez, a music student and instructor who wrote a humorous vocal transcription of Fergie’s rendition that circulated online in the wake of the performance.
