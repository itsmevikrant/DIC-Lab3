Ando, David Chang’s Meal-Delivery Business, Ends Service
Ando, David Chang’s “restaurant without walls,” a meal-delivery enterprise that started two years ago, has closed. The storefront on West 14th Street near Union Square, which opened in the fall and was supposed to enhance the service’s profile, has also closed.
Ando is being absorbed by Uber Eats, the restaurant delivery app operated by Uber. The ride-hailing service had been doing the deliveries for Ando, so it’s a natural fit.
In a statement, Jason Droege, the vice president of Uber Everything, the umbrella under which Uber Eats operates, said, “We are committed to investing in technology that helps consumers and restaurant partners alike.”
This is not Mr. Chang’s first attempt to create a food delivery service that goes beyond simply picking up pizzas and burgers from a nearby restaurant. He was a partner in Maple, which started delivering food in the spring of 2015. The service was eventually sold to the London-based company Deliveroo.
Mr. Chang could not be reached for comment. On the Ando website, he thanked all those who supported the company. A spokeswoman for Mr. Chang referred all inquiries to Uber.
