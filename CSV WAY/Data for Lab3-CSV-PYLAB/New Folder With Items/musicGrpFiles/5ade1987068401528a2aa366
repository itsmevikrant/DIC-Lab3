Jason Aldean Earns the First Country No. 1 of 2018
“Rearview Town,” the new album by the country star Jason Aldean — his first since the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas in October, when a gunman opened fire as Mr. Aldean was performing — opened at No. 1 on this week’s Billboard album chart, making it the first country No. 1 of 2018.
“Rearview Town,” released by the Broken Bow label, a division of BMG, had the equivalent of 183,000 album sales in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. That total includes 162,000 copies sold of the full album, and about 20 million streams of its songs. The album is Mr. Aldean’s fourth No. 1 in a row.
Last week’s No. 1, Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy,” fell to No. 2 in its second week out. Also on this week’s chart, the band Breaking Benjamin opens at No. 3 with “Ember” and the veteran singer-songwriter John Prine opened in fifth place — his highest chart position in a nearly five-decade career — with “The Tree of Forgiveness.”
The soundtrack to “The Greatest Showman,” which has been hovering near the top of the chart since January, is No. 4.
