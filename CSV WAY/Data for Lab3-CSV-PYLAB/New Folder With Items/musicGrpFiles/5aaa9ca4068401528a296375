Drake Conquers Another Streaming Service: Twitch
Drake isn’t content to just break music records anymore.
Two months after the rapper set new highs on streaming services for his No. 1 single “God’s Plan,” he upended the gaming community on Wednesday night by showing up on Twitch, the video game streaming platform, to play the survival game Fortnite. Signing on as TheBoyDuddus, Drake formed a team with the professional gamer Tyler Blevins, who goes by Ninja and has the largest audience on Twitch, with 3.4 million followers.
The stream was soon trending on Twitter, and it hit around 630,000 concurrent views, blowing away the previous record on a single-player stream of 388,000. The pair were also joined by the rapper Travis Scott and the Steelers wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster as players in the game, where teams battle to be the last one standing in an apocalyptic landscape.
While running around on grassy knolls and shooting down enemies, Drake said he has been playing Fortnite for a month or two, and uses it as a reprieve from recording sessions: “We stay in the studio for so long, sometimes for 15-20 hours. It’s just nice to take a little mental break.” He also talked about filming his viral “God’s Plan” video, for which he gave out $1 million: “It was really the best time of my life.”
Later, the rapper Logic issued a challenge as well:
The high-wattage streaming session is another sign of the gaming industry emerging as a major force in mainstream culture. Amazon bought Twitch for $1.1 billion in 2014, as gamer communities were tuning in around the world in numbers that rivaled the average prime-time viewership of some cable networks. Rappers like Post Malone, XXXTentacion and Lil Yachty are increasingly dipping their toes into gaming culture as a place to market their music or interact with fans without a buffer.
