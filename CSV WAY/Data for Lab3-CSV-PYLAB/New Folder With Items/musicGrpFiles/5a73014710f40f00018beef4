Review: Andrea Bocelli, From Cradle to Stage in ‘The Music of Silence’
How much of “The Music of Silence” is true and how much fiction, only its inspiration, the singer Andrea Bocelli, knows for sure. Adapted from Mr. Bocelli’s 1999 novel of the same name (a story he has described as “similar to” his own life), this blah trudge from cradle to stage will be catnip to his fans and Ambien to everyone else.
Directed by Michael Radford (no stranger to corny, middle-of-the-road snoozers) with more attention to chronology than creativity, the story dallies so long in its hero’s leafy Tuscan childhood that we’re more than halfway through before anything resembling a singing career materializes. Before then, we learn about the glaucoma that rendered him virtually blind, the soccer accident that exacerbated the condition and the love of music set aside in favor of a law degree.
Around him, primarily Italian actors gamely wrestle with thickly accented English dialogue, most of it hagiographic and all of it dull. The object of their admiration, meanwhile — here called Amos Bardi and played as an adult by Toby Sebastian — is a singularly bland talent, a mopey presence in cardigans and corduroy. Yet my sympathies are all with Mr. Sebastian: It can’t be easy to create a dynamic character when you’re unable to fully open your eyes.
The filmmakers have no such excuse. Not until Antonio Banderas arrives to play Maestro, the crucial voice coach who knocks Amos into shape, does this metronomic slog to stardom muster a pulse. He’s too late to save the movie, but he’s just in time to stop us from nodding off altogether.
