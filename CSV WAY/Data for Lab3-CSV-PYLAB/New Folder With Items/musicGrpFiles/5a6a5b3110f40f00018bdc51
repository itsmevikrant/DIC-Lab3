Punk Music, Bronx Style
Who knew the Bronx had punks? This shouldnât come as a surprise, since several musical genres were born in the borough, starting with doo-wop in the 1950s, salsa in the ’60s and hip-hop in the ’70s. Now Roy Baizan has discovered another scene.
From basements to backyards, black and Latino rockers and bands, along with their fans, have been gathering at shows staged by Hydro Punk, a brother-and-sister-run collective based in Van Nest. But the music is more â much more â than punk.
âThereâs a mix of rock and punk, but also rap, trap and hip-hop,â Mr. Baizan said. âThatâs why theyâre Hydro, theyâre fluid, itâs not just one thing,â he continued. The events were created, he said, for âBronx youth who took that D.I.Y. attitude and made it their own.â
Mr. Baizan, 21, started taking pictures in his senior year of high school, intrigued by a classmateâs film camera. He went on to study photography, and he later became a teaching assistant at the International Center of Photographyâs youth program at the Point, a cultural and community organization in Hunts Point. While there, he saw a photo essay on âCheeze,â a local graffiti artist who had been murdered. The pictures, by Danny R. Peralta, made an impression on Mr. Baizan.
âThey could have just told another story on a teen killed in the Bronx,â he said. âThings like this happen, but Danny showed that he was not only a graffiti artist, he was a friend, son and his murder affected a lot of people.â
Mr. Baizan brings a similar sensibility to his photography. His 18-year-old brother, Tony, has also joined him in documenting the bands and fans at Hydro Punk and other venues, like the hard-core concerts held in the basement of a Fordham University dormitory.
âAt every show, my brother and I are covered in sweat, beer and sometimes blood on our jackets,â Roy Baizan said. âOur knuckles swollen the way we both shoot, we try to capture what it feels like in the pit being in this almost spiritual, tribal dance.â
