Tapping Apples
Dear Diary:
I was in the neighborhood supermarket clutching the list my wife had given me and buying my groceries for the weekend.
I was in the fruit section vetting the Gala apples carefully with a special technique I learned from a neighbor. It entails tapping each apple you pick up. If you hear a dull thud, the apple is dry and not good. If the sound is sharp, the apple will be crunchy and juicy on the inside.
I had selected about 10 apples this way when I noticed that two workers tending to the fruit were watching me with questioning looks on their faces.
I smiled and told them how the apple-picking technique worked. They were delighted by my explanation. They said it was new and interesting to them and that we all learned something new everyday. We exchanged smiles and pleasantries, and I proceeded on with my shopping.
After leaving the store, I passed a delivery truck parked out front. I heard a pulsating salsa beat. I was surprised to see the two workers I had just been talking to swaying to the music as they unloaded the truck.
I stopped and, with a big smile, said it was my turn to learn. I did some awkward steps, and the three of us laughed and clapped. The people passing by smiled in silent approval as if signaling for us to continue.
