NEW ORLEANS —  The Latest on the opening day of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (all times local):
6 p.m.
Sting drew throngs to one of the largest stages of the New Orleans & Heritage Festival as he launched into an array of crowd favorites like Synchohicity II and Every Little Thing She Does is Magic.
Thousands crowded onto the large infield of the Fair Grounds Race Course on Friday to hear him  — or any of well over 60 other acts performing on more than a dozen outdoor stages.
Clear skies, light breezes and comfortably cool temperatures added to the joyous atmosphere.
The annual spring celebration continues through Sunday and picks up again next Thursday.
The joyous atmosphere was tempered for many by news of the death Thursday of saxophonist Charles Neville, a stalwart of the Neville Brothers Band for three decades. Charles Neville's brother Aaron is scheduled to perform next weekend.
